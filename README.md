*Important Warning about Java-Pro article!*
===========================================

In my article about Web Components in the first printed issue of the [Java-Pro magazine](http://java-pro.de) the designer made a few mistakes (replaced characters and hyphenation of source code ‚Äì the online version of the tutorial is already fixed). As a result, some code examples does not work any more. I created a PDF with corrections which you can download from my website: [Java-Pro_Korrektur.pdf](https://www.fihlon.ch/downloads/Java-Pro_Korrektur.pdf)
